A highly-pigmented matte lip color that provides non-drying comfort on the lips and leaves a suede finish.

What it does:
This Intensely rich color goes on with full coverage and sets with a soft touch matte finish. Formulated with a complex of natural oils and seed butters to enhance moisturize for up to four hours, it provides a protective layer against dryness. These lip colors are available in a universal shade palette, ranging from light to deep tones, across mid-tonal and bright hues of pinks to berries, reds and corals, and nudes and browns.

Presented in a jewelry box and offered with a silk carrying pouch, the design mirrors an objet d'art so intimate as to be worn like a precious jewel; it transforms a forgotten object into a woman's magic wand. The colors are available in three finishes—silky satin, velvet matte, and sheer voile—each with its own design. Each lip color features a unique elixir vial design with a silk ribbon to transform the lipstick into a necklace. The solid black or gold metal body holds the iconic Rouge Louboutin lip color.

Each Rouge Louboutin shade comes in a black lipstick case, and all the other shades are encased in a gold case.

What else you need to know:
Designer and creator of objects, Christian Louboutin has transformed the everyday lipstick into a woman’s magic talisman. This lip color represents a beautiful object d’art worthy of display, yet so intimate as to be worn like a precious jewel.

What it does:
Rouge Dior Ultra Rouge is the first incredibly long-wearing lipstick with the comfort of a Dior lip ink. Ultra Rouge offers a lightweight, ultra-comfortable formula and all the color of a high-pigment lipstick. With up to 12-hour wear*, the colors seem more saturated, with a luminous, semi-matte finish, incredible sensoriality, and hydration.

Always at the cutting edge, Dior challenged its research department to combine the desire for dazzling color with the need for long-lasting comfort. The result of much research and in-depth scientific studies, Rouge Dior Ultra Rouge is Dior’s first lipstick to combine a polymer with a plant-based oil to deliver absolute hydration, comfort, and up to 12 hours of wear* with no tight or dry sensation.

*Instrumental test on 20 subjects. Does not apply to shade 000.

What else you need to know:
Rouge Dior Ultra Rouge is available in 26 ultra-saturated, couture shades with a luminous, semi-matte finish. Four it-shades of Ultra Rouge make especially strong statements:

999 Ultra Dior: “You can never be too much of a woman, so enjoy it.” Red par excellence, iconic yet different.

770 Ultra Love: “Believe in yourself. If you don’t, who will?” This loved-up raspberry is easy to wear, yet has a strong temperament, setting the tone for rosewoods and beiges that border on coral.

851 Ultra Shock: “It’s better to be shocking than boring.” A high-impact, heady burgundy that carries intense shades in its wake, from wines and deep browns to greyish taupes and deep purples.

777 Ultra Star: “All of us are stars, aren't we?” Poppy stars in a palette of bright hues fed on pop culture.

Alongside these potent reds, two collectible shades stand out. These two extreme shades can either be worn alone, making a powerful statement, or as a base or finishing touch, modifying shades to play with colors and intensities:

111 Ultra Night 47: A black that enables you to intensify each shade or practice your lip artistry.

000 Ultra Light 47: A pure white to neutralize your natural lip color or soften another shade.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the health of the skin or support the integrity of their formulations. The brand focuses on healthy pH levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support the skin’s acid mantle. All of their products are designed to be mixed together—what Drunk Elephant calls making a smoothie. (This is true for all of their products except their sunscreen, Umbra, which sits on top of the skin, protecting it from UV damage.) The result is skin that is reset to its happiest, healthiest state.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Solutions for:
- Dryness

If you want to know more…
Kopari’s cult favorite, petroleum-free lip gloss is formulated with squalane (derived from olives), shea butter, and 100 percent organic coconut oil to leave your lips silky-soft and hydrated to perfection. Use it to layer over your liquid lipstick for a smooth and non-sticky finish. This product can also be used as an eye or cheek gloss. It has the perfect slip and will love on lips all day and night.

Kopari’s coconut oil is a skin win. It has the highest fatty acid concentration of any oil on the planet. The good fats soak into the skin and lock in moisture. It is also one of the only oils to contain lauric acid (also found in mother's milk), which is antibacterial and antimicrobial—meaning it helps fight inflammation and keep redness at bay.

This soothing formula rejuvenates the lip surface, defines and strengthens lip borders, and locks in hydration to provide lasting moisture to dehydrated and damaged lips.

What else you need to know:
The lip skin is a unique and delicate bridge between the skin inside your mouth and the skin on your face. Lip skin is thinner, making it more susceptible to collagen loss. It also lacks the ability to lubricate itself, making it vulnerable to moisture loss and damage caused by free radicals and environmental aggressors, and drying lipsticks & stains. Hyaluronic Marine™ Collagen Lip Cushion's clean formulation helps restore, redefine, and revive lips.

Research results:
In a consumer study after using the products for 3 days:
- 96% agreed their lips felt smooth and roughness had decreased
- 94% agreed their lips felt hydrated and soft
- 88% agreed their lips looked and felt healthier
