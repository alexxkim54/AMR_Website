A groundbreaking hybrid that combines the customized lighting effects of Ambient Lighting Powder or Strobe Powder with a spectrum of breathtakingly modern hues.

What it does:
While traditional blush tends to be flat, the Ambient® Lighting Blush Collection uses Photoluminescent Technology to exhibit depth and dimension with seamless blending. The handmade powders are formulated using an advanced miscelare technique—which means ""to mix"" in Italian—creating the perfect balance of pigment and powder. No two look alike.

The Ambient® Lighting Blush Collection features airy, lightweight blushes to flatter a range of skin tones. Hourglass’s original collection of Ambient® Lighting Blush fuses universally flattering Ambient Lighting Powders with vivid cheek colors for soft-focus, multidimensional color with a naturally radiant finish. The new collection of Ambient Strobe Lighting Blush fuses the illuminating effects of Ambient Strobe Lighting Powder with modern color to brighten cheeks for glowing, lit-from-within color with a shimmer finish.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates
- Phthalates

What else you need to know:
The optically transparent particles alter the appearance of the skin by manipulating and refracting favorable light. The result is skin that looks smooth, even, and enhanced—not masked. The soft-focus technology helps to minimize the look of wrinkles and imperfections, neutralize discoloration, and emulate the appearance of young, healthy skin.

""Traditional blush can read as flat, and so I was inspired to create something that was far more seamless. The Ambient Lighting Blush Collection fuses two advanced formulas to create something entirely new. It’s unlike any other product on the market.""—Carisa Janes, Hourglass Brand Founder

""NUDESTIX supports Love is Louder because we believe in loving yourself, loving your imperfectly, perfect self and loving your quirkiness. Love the REAL you, because that is what makes you unique and beautiful!""—Ally and Taylor

NUDESTIX is the brainchild of sisters Ally and Taylor (as well as their chemical engineer mother, Jenny), who love all-out natural makeup, opting for that barely-there look with only a touch of color to accentuate their finest features. After explaining that current makeup brands and collections simply don’t apple to their no-nonsense attitude, they created this concealer pencil. NUDESTIX believes that your natural skin should thrive, and that you only need to cover here and there to get that perfectly, ""go nude but better"" look. Flaunt your ‘pretty pout’ proudly and snap a seflie #n_stix and get #instafamous.

""We love when the same color is used on the lip and cheek for perfect harmony to create the perfect NUDESTIX face. Go nude, but better. ;)""— Ally and Taylor, NUDESTIX models
