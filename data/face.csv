The HUDA BEAUTY Easy Bake Loose Powders are inspired by Huda’s strong belief that the technique of baking is a key step to creating a flawless finish, while also ensuring long-lasting, melt-proof makeup.

Easy Bake is easy to use thanks to its unique powder net, which disperses a controlled amount of powder. By following Huda’s step-by-step guide, you’ll be able to brighten and revitalize the look of your under-eye area, while also enhancing the contours of your face—in as little as a few minutes.

This extremely light and silky texture blends seamlessly into the skin, leaving it matte with a hint of sheen for a luminous finish that controls shine throughout the day.

HUDA BEAUTY created eight shades of Easy Bake, packed with ultra-refined pigments, to ensure the right fit for all skin tones. The powders work to subtly color correct and highlight different contours of the face, leaving a translucent veil of color on your skin—so you can bake, without the cake.

A velvety priming balm of pressed silk that smooths and makes makeup last longer while keeping it out of skin, helping to prevent clogged pores and breakouts.

Solutions for:
- Pores
- Oiliness
- Dullness and uneven texture

If you want to know more…
This multitasking skin-protecting, makeup-perfecting primer is for face, eyes, and lips. Silk extracts feel nourishing on skin and diminish the look of pores, fines lines, and imperfections for the perfect canvas before makeup. Silk powder makes makeup glide on more evenly and last longer, minimizing excess shine with a soft focus finish. A protective layer derived from botanicals acts as a barrier between makeup and skin, helping to prevent clogged pores that can lead to breakouts. Anti-pollution natural active ingredients fight immediate attack from environmental stressors and help support the skin’s barrier function to act against future attack, visibly reducing the appearance of wrinkles and dullness. Pink and gold pearl helps even skin tone for a healthy look, and hadasei-3—a trinity of Japanese superfoods green tea, rice, and algae—visibly restores youthful radiance.

What else you need to know:
This product is noncomedogenic, non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, cruelty-free, and formulated without synthetic fragrances, mineral oil, sulfate detergents, urea, DEA, or TEA.

The journey of The Silk Canvas to you: the final step of the geisha’s skincare ritual—and the beginning of her makeup—is to press a thin layer of melted Japanese wax called Bintsuke into her skin. This soft layer creates a smooth, poreless canvas to help her makeup last all day and protect her skin beneath. Tatcha brings a modern evolution of this time-honored practice to life in The Silk Canvas.

Beauty that gives back: every Tatcha purchase you make supports girls’ education around the world. Tatcha is proud to partner with Room to Read to transform girls’ futures.—Victoria Tsai, Founder

For Rihanna, creating the perfect soft matte base is the most important part of any look—and the first step to the FENTY Face, her real-life method for killer radiance.

“Foundation is one of those areas in the beauty industry that has a big void for women at extreme ends of the shade spectrum. There’s this middle ground that's covered really, really well. But then if you’re very pale or if you’re very dark, there aren’t a lot of options. And so, I wanted to make sure that women of all skin tones were covered so they could be included in what I created.”—Rihanna, Brand Founder

As a California girl, Kate loves the outdoors and being in the sun, but also realizes that you need to protect your skin from the harmful effects of the sun by using sunscreen. Most people however don’t use sunscreen as directed (reapplying every two hours) for a number of reasons: they forget to re-apply, it can be messy or time consuming, they applied their sunscreen under their makeup and don’t want to remove and reapply, and more. So Kate decided to create a sunscreen that was simple and effective yet uncomplicated. With UncompliKated SPF, you just spray and go, leaving your makeup set and your skin protected from the damaging effects of UVA/UVB rays.

Kate Somerville has been certified cruelty-free by PETA, solidifying the brand’s commitment to never test their products or ingredients on animals.

Each Ultra HD Underpainting Color Correction Palette was developed by MAKE UP FOR EVER’s pro artist teams and tested on a wide range of skin tones to ensure precise and undetectable color correction—ridding skin of unwanted darkness, redness, and dull areas. As with the other Ultra HD products, a signature combination of coated pigments, powders, and a blend of emollient oils provide a second skin, seamless look and feel.

It comes in a full range of six palettes to ensure that each and every skin tone’s targeted concerns are resolved with two shades to color correct and camouflage any imperfections, as well as two shades to conceal and build coverage as needed. Whether your skin tone is very fair or deep, you’ll find all the skin-saving solutions you could ever need in this single palette.

What else you need to know:
The color corrector shades help camouflage discoloration and imperfections. Apply the concealer shades over the corrector shades to adjust color back to a natural skin tone, while providing medium to full, buildable coverage with a natural finish.

Choose the palette that best fits the needs of your individual skin tone:

20 Very Fair: Mauve brightens sallowness. Light yellow neutralizes redness.
 
25 Light: Light green corrects redness. Light peach brightens the under-eye area.

30 Medium: Olive green corrects overall redness and blemishes. Peach corrects dark circles.

40 Tan: Dark peach counteracts dark circles with blue undertones. Yellow ochre evens out by correcting overall redness in skin tone.

50 Dark: Brick corrects deep hyperpigmentation. Caramel neutralizes dark spots for an even complexion.

55 Deep: Orange corrects hyperpigmentation under eyes or face. Dark brown deepens lighter areas of the skin.","Light Green:

It also refines, protects, and evens-out skin tone. Matissime Velvet is enriched with black cumin oil, which is renowned for its purifying benefits, and helps protect the skin and reveal its pure beauty. On application, burnet, ginger, and cinnamon extracts help diminish the look of pores and small imperfections.

The light, liquid texture of Matissime Velvet leaves a luminous and unifying matte finish on the skin that preserves its fine texture and natural glow. The complexion stays matte, luminous, smooth, and perfectly even all day long.

What else you need to know:
Annie wanted to create a completely talc-free translucent setting powder that uses the absence of talc to its advantage. Talc's density can make it heavy and drying, which is one of the biggest reasons powders can tend to accentuate fine lines and cling to texture on the skin. Instead of talc, LAWLESS uses mica as the base of Seal the Deal Loose Translucent Setting Powders. Mica has a very lightweight, translucent finish that sets makeup all day without adding any weight or cakiness, or disturbing the finish of your base.

A finishing powder with the practicality of a compact and the luminosity of a liquid foundation, giving you the best of both worlds on-the-go.

What it does:
NEO NUDE FUSION POWDER is the first finishing powder to combine similar ingredients to a luminous liquid foundation, with the clean application and nomadic practicality of a compact. Backed by 10 years of research, NEO NUDE FUSION POWDER features two of Giorgio Armani’s new, groundbreaking, patented technologies.

Available in 12 shades, NEO NUDE FUSION POWDER contains a high-performance color fusion emulsion with advanced pigments that maintain a skin-matching veil, which stays true no matter how many touch-ups you make throughout the day.

Floating weightlessly onto the skin like a cloud, the secret to its brilliance lies in Giorgio Armani beauty Laboratories’ new patent: the water memory formulation process. During formulation, water within the powder evaporates, leaving a powder texture behind. Upon contact with the natural moisture found within the skin, the process is reversed: the powder transforms into a veil-like liquid that becomes one with the skin, avoiding harsh lines, smears or caking over time. A second patent creates a soft, weightless powder—so thin it appears invisible. The result is a look that’s you, but better—it’s your Armani nude.

What else you need to know:
Giorgio Armani beauty introduces a complete NEO NUDE range for skin, cheeks, and lips, with the promise of “no makeup makeup” perfection. Invisible, mistake-proof, and sensorial—it delivers everything a woman needs to feel confident and to embody the signature Armani glow.","Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Talc ,Lauroyl Lysine ,Octyldodecanol ,Sorbitan Isostearate , Isotridecyl Isononanoate ,Dimethicone , Zea Mays Starch / Corn Starch , Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer ,Phenoxyethanol , Argilla / Magnesium Aluminum Silicate , Polysorbate 80 , Silica , Xanthan Gum , Tin Oxide , Isobutane , Caprylyl Glycol , Acrylonitrile/Methyl Methacrylate/Vinylidene Chloride, Copolymer , Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate , Petrolatum , Aqua / Water , Aluminum Hydroxide , Laureth-4 .",Setting Spray & Powder

The lightweight texture applies smoothly and evenly for a second-skin feel, whether using a brush, sponge, or your fingers.

A full-coverage concealer inspired by Urban Decay’s bestselling All Nighter Liquid Foundation.

What it does:
Urban Decay’s All Nighter Waterproof Full-Coverage Concealer provides flawless matte coverage that lasts all day and all night. Cover anything and get a perfectly blown-out effect. UD’s ultra-pigmented, blendable formula controls shine and masks imperfections for up to 24 hours, and the beautiful, modern-matte finish never looks overdone.

Just like All Nighter Liquid Foundation, All Nighter Concealer covers everything—and lasts through whatever kind of trouble you might find. It hides even the most hard-to-cover spots and sins from the night before, and UD’s waterproof formula stays put until the morning light. Plus, All Nighter Concealer absorbs oil to keep skin looking beautifully matte.

A major problem solver, All Nighter Concealer handles all your hardest-to-hide trouble spots: dark circles, blemishes, and discoloration. It even covers tattoos. This formula works beautifully with All Nighter Liquid Foundation or Naked Skin Liquid Makeup. With meticulously calibrated shades that span the complexion spectrum from pale to deep, All Nighter Concealer has every skin tone covered.

There’s no need to build your coverage or apply multiple layers. Always use All Nighter Concealer after you put on your foundation. Just apply a tiny amount and gently tap it into skin with your finger, the UD Pro Concealer Brush, or the UD Pro The Finger Brush (brushes sold separately) for beautiful results.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens

What else you need to know:
This long-lasting formula provides much higher coverage than Naked Skin Concealer. That’s because UD increased the pigment level by 73 percent. A high-tech blend of polymers and humectants provides ultra-long, flawless wear and prevents All Nighter Concealer from settling into fine lines and pores. Just like All Nighter Liquid Foundation, this formula features light-diffusing pigments to blur flaws for a soft-focus effect.

All Nighter Concealer comes in a gorgeous bottle that’s like a little, covetable version of UD’s All Nighter Liquid Foundation component—with a luxurious, highly metallized gunmetal effect and asymmetric cutouts. As beautiful as the component is, it’s also practical and travel-friendly. No need to carry a brush. The angled, flocked paddle applicator has a little well at the end that provides a precise laydown of product exactly where you need it.
