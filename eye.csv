-Carefully remove eyelash from tray by easing them away from the half-moon in a downward motion.
-Measure the lash against your eye. Cut away any excess lash from the outer corner.
-Hold each end of the lash band, create a c-shape by bringing the corners inwards to flex the lash. Adding this curve to the band will help when applying to the eyelid.
-Apply lash glue to the band and wait approximately 20 to 30 seconds for glue to become tacky.
-Once tacky, look downards into a mirror to apply lash to your eyelid. Position the band as close to your natural lashes as possible. Apply to center of eyelid first, then apply inner and outer corners.
-Allow glue to dry thoroughly, once dried it will be clear.
-If you would like to further blend the false lash to your natural lash, apply a bit of mascara. This is optional.

Removal:
-Tip: Remove lashes before you remove any of your eye makeup. Removing carefully will allow lash to be reused numerous times.
-Hold the lash at outer corner and peel it off the eyelid from the outer corner towards the nose (it won't hurt).
-Add a little of an oily substance to a cue-tip and run along lashline to help soften the glue if needed.",False Eyelashes,62

Patrick's technique: ""For that full, brushed-up look I've been doing, I start by really wetting the product before picking it up with my spoolie. Then I comb the product through the brows, brushing upwards, making sure each hair is thoroughly coated and wet. Let the product dry down for a second, just enough to get tacky, then use the handle of your spoolie to press the hair into place in an upward motion, ""laminating"" the brows against the skin. You can then gently brush through and shape them as you want. The great thing about this formula is that it's strong, but not stiff or crunchy, and you can just brush through and reshape throughout the day.""","-Growth Peptides: Support healthy new growth.

A buildable, water-based liner that contains superfine glitter in a clear base.

What it does:
All the glitz of glam rock—without the spandex or bad hair—Urban Decay’s Heavy Metal Glitter Eyeliner contains superfine glitter in a clear base that dries down quickly and really stays put (for long wear without any fallout). Wear it alone, apply it over Urban Decay’s eyeshadow, or layer two shades together for a more intense effect.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Sulfates
- Phthalates

What else you need to know:
The precise, thin-tipped brush makes it easy to create fine, glittery lines. Want more sparkle? Use the side of the brush to sweep sparkle all over your lids. Or, for an even bolder, jewel-encrusted look, remove the wiper (the little piece that controls how much product comes out of the bottle) and tap on Heavy Metal with your fingers. The glitter is suspended in a gel, so it won’t separate in the bottle. Peach and cucumber extract condition the skin, while carrot extract smooths and softens.

Each palette features its own shade personality:
Provocouture (dusty plum and magenta): Say it with style; otherwise, you might as well just stay in bed.
Glambition (bare and bronze): She was infamous, known for seeking the most over-the-top glamour.
Frivoluxe (chilled greige and violet): Fabulous! Always dress outrageously and how you want. Who has time for less?
Scandalust (rust and warmed browns with scarlet): Hot pants at the office cause a fuss; that’s why they call her little miss scandalous.
Edgitorial (camouflage and reflective gold): Take a memo. Next season, we’ll see, pleather python, making a scene, enviously, everywhere.
Sartorial (celestial cobalt and icy teal with prismatic gray): Whenever in doubt: power platforms. Make sure (for once) they know who runs the show.

An innovative, water-resistant mascara with tube technology for maximum hold.

What it does:
Blinc Mascara is the original tube technology mascara. It's invented to form tiny water-resistant ""tubes"" around your lashes for maximum amplification and hold, rather than painting them like conventional mascaras. Once applied, the tubes bind to your lashes and don't run, smudge, clump, or flake, even if you cry or rub your eyes.

What else you need to know:
This mascara adds both volume and length to give you a radiant natural look that lasts all day. Neither water nor pressure alone will remove Blinc Mascara. Only the combination of lots of warm water and gentle pressure (no need for harsh makeup removers) will slide the tiny tubes effortlessly off your lashes into your hand. Upon removal, you will actually see the tiny tubes slide into your hand.

Blinc Mascara has been clinically tested to be non-irritating, making it ideal for sensitive eyes, contact lens wearers, and active people in search of a mascara whose look, hold, and ease of removal is without compromise.","-Avobenzone (2%): Sunscreen.

A tube-forming, water-resistant mascara that gives buildable, glamorous volume with no smudging, flaking, running, or clumping.

What it does:
After almost a decade in development, Blinc Mascara Amplified provides incredible, buildable volume and length, all while offering their signature LifeProof properties of the original Blinc Mascara—smudge-proof, sweat-proof, water-resistant, and flake-proof. As with the original, Mascara Amplified coats lashes with a glossy, volumizing and extending coat that forms tiny water-resistant “tubes” around the lash. But, unlike the first formula, this one applies more like a traditional mascara, giving you the ability to add as many coats as you want to build your desired look! Because it is not as wet of a formula, you can even go back and reapply if needed, after it dries.

What else you need to know:
Removing Blinc Mascara Amplified is just as easy, and requires no makeup remover. Simply apply a little warm water along with some gentle pressure, and the tubes easily slide off your lashes. You will actually see the tiny tubes in your hand as it comes off without leaving any messy black tint or residue behind.","Water, Ammonium Acrylates Copolymer, Iron Oxides (Ci 77499), Iron Oxides (Ci 77499), Glyceryl Stearate, Beeswax/Cera Alba, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Stearic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Mica, Silica, Phenoxyethanol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Laureth-21, Trisodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Nitrate, Disodium Phosphate, Polysorbate 60, Sodium Phosphate.",Mascara,1502

A pro-formulated color correcting cream palette with curated shade ranges for a perfectly even, primed complexion with long-lasting wear.

What it does:
Each Ultra HD Underpainting Color Correction Palette was developed by MAKE UP FOR EVER’s pro artist teams and tested on a wide range of skin tones to ensure precise and undetectable color correction—ridding skin of unwanted darkness, redness, and dull areas. As with the other Ultra HD products, a signature combination of coated pigments, powders, and a blend of emollient oils provide a second skin, seamless look and feel.

It comes in a full range of six palettes to ensure that each and every skin tone’s targeted concerns are resolved with two shades to color correct and camouflage any imperfections, as well as two shades to conceal and build coverage as needed. Whether your skin tone is very fair or deep, you’ll find all the skin-saving solutions you could ever need in this single palette.

What else you need to know:
The color corrector shades help camouflage discoloration and imperfections. Apply the concealer shades over the corrector shades to adjust color back to a natural skin tone, while providing medium to full, buildable coverage with a natural finish.

Choose the palette that best fits the needs of your individual skin tone:

20 Very Fair: Mauve brightens sallowness. Light yellow neutralizes redness.
 
25 Light: Light green corrects redness. Light peach brightens the under-eye area.

30 Medium: Olive green corrects overall redness and blemishes. Peach corrects dark circles.

40 Tan: Dark peach counteracts dark circles with blue undertones. Yellow ochre evens out by correcting overall redness in skin tone.

50 Dark: Brick corrects deep hyperpigmentation. Caramel neutralizes dark spots for an even complexion.

55 Deep: Orange corrects hyperpigmentation under eyes or face. Dark brown deepens lighter areas of the skin.","Light Green:

Like a hair mask for your brows, hemp-derived cannabis seed oil conditions and won’t cause stiffness or flaking.

The tapered, tree-shaped brush with dense, firm bristles allows you to deposit gel evenly across your brows so each hair stays put.

KUSH Clear Brow Gel is cruelty-free, paraben-free, vegan, gluten-free, and silicone-free.

Why is it formulated with cannabis? First came KUSH Mascara. Milk Makeup has now ventured into brow territory with KUSH Clear Brow Gel. Because the brand is 100 percent vegan, they knew they couldn’t use beeswax, a common binding component in brow gel formulas. So, they went back to their vegan formula hero, hemp-derived cannabis seed oil. It tames and sets brow hair without stiffness or flaking. It also provides an additional conditioning benefit for healthier-looking brows. KUSH Clear Brow Gel is the vegan way to tame brows in one hit.

What else you need to know:
Internationally renowned makeup artist Natasha Denona developed her own eyeshadow formulas after struggling for over 20 years with eyeshadows that were dry, dull, and difficult to blend.

""When I launched these palettes everyone told me I was crazy because there are so many shades inside. I made them like this because I had to create a kit with all the basic colors that came in cool tones and warm tones from light to dark and in several textures. My 28 Palettes have become world renowned and the favorites of Desi Perkins, Nikki Tutorials, Wayne Goss, Kathleen Lights, and Jaclyn Hill. The formula is out of this world! It was a dream for me to create a pressed pigment that was easy for everyone to use. You can create endless looks with the 28 Palette. It’s a revolutionary product and a must have for everyone.""—Natasha Denona

What's great skin without The Good Brow? Josie's dual-ended argan-infused brow and highlight wand gives you glowing, juicy skin and natural-looking, volumized brows to round out any look and perfectly frame your face. The micropigmented brow adheres to skin and hair to outline, fill, volumize, and shape brows with ease. Flip the wand over and sweep the universally flattering rosé highlighter under your brow, in the inner corner of the eye, across your cheekbones, and down your nose to brighten and enhance skin and bone structure. Organic argan oil and coconut oil nourishes and conditions for fuller, healthier-looking brows and infuses skin with nutrient-rich essential vitamins. It's all you need for good brows, good vibes, and great skin.

Josie's tip: use The Good Brow to create a complete look. Use the brow side as a cream eyeliner, eye shadow, lipliner, and contour pencil to add definition and depth. Use the highlighting side on the inner and outer corner of your eyes, under the browbone, on your cheekbones, down your nose, on your Cupid’s bow, and on your décolleté to highlight, nourish, and catch the perfect light at all angles.

Whether you go for a 60’s cat-eye flick like Ally or prefer a more playful and subtle metallic look like Taylor, you’ll love exploring all the eye-lining possibilities!”—Ally and Taylor Frankel, NUDESTIX Co-founders and Chief Inspiration Officers

“The NUDESTIX Rock N’ Roller Easy Eyeliner Ink is one of my favorite things to use for filling in the lash line.

A full-coverage concealer inspired by Urban Decay’s bestselling All Nighter Liquid Foundation.

What it does:
Urban Decay’s All Nighter Waterproof Full-Coverage Concealer provides flawless matte coverage that lasts all day and all night. Cover anything and get a perfectly blown-out effect. UD’s ultra-pigmented, blendable formula controls shine and masks imperfections for up to 24 hours, and the beautiful, modern-matte finish never looks overdone.

Just like All Nighter Liquid Foundation, All Nighter Concealer covers everything—and lasts through whatever kind of trouble you might find. It hides even the most hard-to-cover spots and sins from the night before, and UD’s waterproof formula stays put until the morning light. Plus, All Nighter Concealer absorbs oil to keep skin looking beautifully matte.

A major problem solver, All Nighter Concealer handles all your hardest-to-hide trouble spots: dark circles, blemishes, and discoloration. It even covers tattoos. This formula works beautifully with All Nighter Liquid Foundation or Naked Skin Liquid Makeup. With meticulously calibrated shades that span the complexion spectrum from pale to deep, All Nighter Concealer has every skin tone covered.

There’s no need to build your coverage or apply multiple layers. Always use All Nighter Concealer after you put on your foundation. Just apply a tiny amount and gently tap it into skin with your finger, the UD Pro Concealer Brush, or the UD Pro The Finger Brush (brushes sold separately) for beautiful results.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens

What else you need to know:
This long-lasting formula provides much higher coverage than Naked Skin Concealer. That’s because UD increased the pigment level by 73 percent. A high-tech blend of polymers and humectants provides ultra-long, flawless wear and prevents All Nighter Concealer from settling into fine lines and pores. Just like All Nighter Liquid Foundation, this formula features light-diffusing pigments to blur flaws for a soft-focus effect.

All Nighter Concealer comes in a gorgeous bottle that’s like a little, covetable version of UD’s All Nighter Liquid Foundation component—with a luxurious, highly metallized gunmetal effect and asymmetric cutouts. As beautiful as the component is, it’s also practical and travel-friendly. No need to carry a brush. The angled, flocked paddle applicator has a little well at the end that provides a precise laydown of product exactly where you need it.

The custom-engineered, dual-molded brush boosts even the skinniest lashes for an exaggerated, voluminous look.
