#  Makeup Recommender

This webpage contains a recommender that will provide a one-stop shop experience where a user will get recommended an array of products to create an entire makeup look based on similar products that the user enjoys, products that similar users have purchased, as well as products that are personalized to the user including skin type, skin tone, allergies, and budget. Each recommendation includes a face, cheek, eye, and lip product. Our project aims to utilize collaborative filtering recommendations along with content-based filtering to ensure user satisfaction and success when creating their desired look.
